# Diabetes-Predictor using machine learning - 
This project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on various health-related metrics. 
It uses machine learning techniques trained on a dataset (e.g., Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset) to provide predictive analysis.

# Features:-
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Model training and evaluation
- Support for multiple ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Web interface (if applicable)

# Dataset:-
- Source: [Kaggle - Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
- Features include: Glucose, Blood Pressure, BMI, Age, etc.

  # Technology used:-
  - Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for web app)

# Installation and usage
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-prediction.git

2. Navigate into the folder:
   cd diabetes-prediction

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb

# Result
- Accuracy: XX%
- Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and other evaluation metrics provided
